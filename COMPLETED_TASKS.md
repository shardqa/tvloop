- **✅ HEADLESS MODE IMPLEMENTED** - mpv now runs without GUI windows during tests
- **Enhanced test environment** - Added TEST_MODE for headless operation
- **Simplified YouTube player** - Cleaned up complex mpv options for better maintainability
- **✅ COMPLETE MOCKING IMPLEMENTED** - All tests now use mock PID files, NO real mpv processes start
- **Fixed error handling tests** - Now use proper mocking instead of real script calls
- **Zero mpv processes during tests** - Complete elimination of real media player processes

### ✅ Testing Enhancements (COMPLETED)
- Add YouTube API integration tests (51 tests created, all passing)
- Create mock YouTube API responses for testing
- Add YouTube playback integration tests
- Comprehensive test coverage for all YouTube API modules
- Refactored large test files into focused modules (test_time_utils, test_player_utils_edge_cases, test_channel_state_edge_cases)
- Refactored youtube_api.sh into focused modules (core, parsing, video, playlist)
- Further split remaining large test files to ensure all files are under 100 lines

### ✅ YouTube Channel-Based Channels (COMPLETED)
- Create 24-hour channels from YouTube channels
- Fetch videos from any YouTube channel automatically
- Build playlists to target duration (24h, 12h, etc.)
- Support multiple channel formats (URL, @username, channel ID)
- Automatic channel initialization and time tracking
- Comprehensive guide and documentation
- Integration with existing channel system
- **yt-dlp Integration** - No API key required alternative
- **Documentation Refactoring** - Split into 16 focused files under 100 lines each
- Full YouTube channel integration (API + yt-dlp)

### ✅ Code Refactoring (Large File Splitting)
- Refactored player_utils.sh into focused modules (player_launcher.sh, player_controller.sh, player_monitor.sh)
- Refactored youtube_setup.md into focused documentation modules
- Refactored youtube_channel_player.sh into focused modules (help, operations, control)
- Refactored youtube_player.sh into focused modules (mpv, vlc, control)
- Refactored youtube_playlist_manager.sh into focused modules (help, creator, operations, info)
- Refactored large test files into focused modules (test_time_utils, test_player_utils_edge_cases, test_channel_state_edge_cases)
- Refactored youtube_api.sh into focused modules (core, parsing, video, playlist)
- Further split remaining large test files to ensure all files are under 100 lines
