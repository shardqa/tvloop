# 24-Hour Video Channel Project - COMPLETED PHASES

## Overview

This document contains the completed phases and test refactoring details for the 24-Hour Video Channel project.

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Basic Time Tracking System
- **Core infrastructure** - Channel state management, playlist management
- **Time tracking system** - Elapsed time calculation, cycle tracking
- **State persistence** - JSON-based state files with start_time, total_duration
- **Playlist parsing** - Video metadata extraction (path, title, duration)
- **Current video calculation** - Position tracking and video selection

### ✅ Phase 2: Video Player Integration
- **MPV/VLC integration** - Player launch and control
- **Playback control** - Start, stop, and timestamp management
- **Timestamp calculation** - Accurate position tracking
- **Player state management** - PID file handling and cleanup
- **Cross-platform support** - Works with both MPV and VLC players

### ✅ Phase 3: Channel Management
- **Multi-channel support** - Independent channel operation
- **Channel switching** - Seamless transitions between channels
- **Configuration management** - Channel-specific settings
- **State isolation** - Independent channel states and playlists
- **Channel configuration files** - INI-style configuration format

### ✅ Phase 4: Local Content Integration
- **Local folder scanning** - Automatic video file discovery
- **Playlist generation** - Dynamic playlist creation from directories
- **Metadata extraction** - Video duration and title detection
- **File format support** - Multiple video format handling (mp4, mkv, avi)
- **Playlist validation** - File existence and format checking

### ✅ Test Refactoring
- **Large test files split** - All files now under 100 lines
- **Helper functions created** - Reusable test utilities
- **Focused test organization** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Bats best practices** - Proper test structure and organization

## Test File Refactoring Details

### ✅ test_player_integration.bats (111 lines) → Split into:
- `test_helper/player_helpers.bash` (30 lines) - Common player setup/teardown
- `test_player_setup.bats` (40 lines) - Basic setup and initialization tests
- `test_player_mpv.bats` (35 lines) - MPV-specific tests
- `test_player_vlc.bats` (35 lines) - VLC-specific tests
- `test_player_control.bats` (40 lines) - Player control and timestamp tests

### ✅ test_channel_management.bats (113 lines) → Split into:
- `test_helper/channel_helpers.bash` (25 lines) - Common channel setup/teardown
- `test_channel_setup.bats` (45 lines) - Basic channel initialization tests
- `test_channel_isolation.bats` (40 lines) - Channel state isolation tests
- `test_channel_switching.bats` (45 lines) - Channel switching and config tests

### ✅ test_content_integration.bats (101 lines) → Split into:
- `test_helper/content_helpers.bash` (25 lines) - Common content setup/teardown
- `test_content_setup.bats` (40 lines) - Basic playlist creation tests
- `test_content_playlist.bats` (40 lines) - Playlist management tests
- `test_content_metadata.bats` (40 lines) - Metadata and format tests
