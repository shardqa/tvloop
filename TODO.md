# 24-Hour Video Channel Project - TODO

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive TODO list for the 24-Hour Video Channel project, organized by development phases and areas of focus.

## Development Phases

- **[Phase 1: Basic Time Tracking System](docs/todo/phase1.md)** - Core infrastructure and time tracking
- **[Phase 2: Video Player Integration](docs/todo/phase2.md)** - Player integration and playback control
- **[Phase 3: Channel Management](docs/todo/phase3.md)** - Multi-channel support and advanced features
- **[Phase 4: Content Source Integration](docs/todo/phase4.md)** - Local and YouTube content integration

## Additional Areas

- **[Testing and Validation](docs/todo/testing.md)** - Functionality and integration testing
- **[Documentation](docs/todo/documentation.md)** - User and technical documentation

## Current Status

The project has completed the initial refactoring phase with all files organized into modular components under 100 lines each. 

**Completed Phases:**
- âœ… **Phase 1: Basic Time Tracking System** - Core infrastructure, channel state management, playlist management
- âœ… **Phase 2: Video Player Integration** - MPV/VLC integration, playback control, timestamp calculation
- âœ… **Phase 3: Channel Management** - Multi-channel support, channel switching, configuration management
- âœ… **Phase 4: Local Content Integration** - Local folder scanning, playlist generation, metadata extraction
- âœ… **Test Refactoring** - Large test files split into focused, maintainable components under 100 lines each

**Remaining Work:**
- ðŸ”„ **Phase 4: YouTube Integration** - YouTube API integration, online playback, subscription management, channel-specific 24-hour programming

## Recent Refactoring (Completed)

**Test File Refactoring:**
- âœ… **test_player_integration.bats** (111 lines) â†’ Split into:
  - `test_helper/player_helpers.bash` (30 lines) - Common player setup/teardown
  - `test_player_setup.bats` (40 lines) - Basic setup and initialization tests
  - `test_player_mpv.bats` (35 lines) - MPV-specific tests
  - `test_player_vlc.bats` (35 lines) - VLC-specific tests
  - `test_player_control.bats` (40 lines) - Player control and timestamp tests

- âœ… **test_channel_management.bats** (113 lines) â†’ Split into:
  - `test_helper/channel_helpers.bash` (25 lines) - Common channel setup/teardown
  - `test_channel_setup.bats` (45 lines) - Basic channel initialization tests
  - `test_channel_isolation.bats` (40 lines) - Channel state isolation tests
  - `test_channel_switching.bats` (45 lines) - Channel switching and config tests

- âœ… **test_content_integration.bats** (101 lines) â†’ Split into:
  - `test_helper/content_helpers.bash` (25 lines) - Common content setup/teardown

  - `test_content_playlist.bats` (40 lines) - Playlist management tests
  - `test_content_metadata.bats` (40 lines) - Metadata and format tests

**Benefits of Refactoring:**
- All test files now under 100 lines as requested
- Clear separation of concerns with focused test files
- Reusable helper functions to avoid code duplication
- Better maintainability and easier debugging
- Follows Bats testing framework best practices
- Improved test organization and readability

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize items in each phase
2. Focus on Phase 1 completion before moving to Phase 2
3. Implement testing alongside feature development
4. Maintain documentation as features are completed
